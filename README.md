This project demonstrates the integration of PoseNet, a machine learning model for real-time human pose estimation, with creative coding and image manipulation using p5.js. The application captures live video input, tracks key body points, and overlays an image dynamically based on the detected nose position. The project serves as a creative exploration of pose tracking technology in a web development context.

Tech Stacks Used

1. ml5.js and PoseNet:
Integrated PoseNet with ml5.js for real-time pose estimation from live video input.
Utilized the PoseNet model to track key body points and skeleton structure.

2. p5.js:
Developed the project using p5.js for canvas manipulation, creative coding, and interactive visualizations.
Leveraged p5.js functions for drawing ellipses, lines, and overlaying images based on PoseNet output.
  
3. Web Technologies:
Applied HTML and JavaScript for creating an interactive web application.
Used web development skills to handle video capture, user interface, and dynamic image overlay.
